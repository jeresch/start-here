# Introduction

## Who should read this book

You may dream of creating the next Minecraft or Flappy Bird, or perhaps you have a list hidden away of ideas for soon-to-be-essential apps.  If, lying in bed or cooking food, you've never entertained even the briefest fantasy of how programming could improve your life \(don't worry, I won't tell\), this book probably isn't for you.  If you have, read on.

## Why learning to program sucks

Despite what many people say, programming is _not_ easy.  Learning to program is sort of like learning a new language, or like learning music, or like learning a new topic in math.  It requires contorting your brain to conceptualize abstractions in unnatural ways.

Learning to program is hard, but why does it suck?  Several reasons:

* There are thousands of resources available, all of them assuming slightly different backgrounds.  As a beginner, it can be really hard to find the resources that match your background.
* People who program have a really hard time remembering what it's like to not have years of experience under their belt.  Multiple inheritance is an issue near and dear to a C++ programmer's heart, and Monads are as familiar to Haskell aficionados as are sidewalks and roads.  Reminding someone that you don't have experience in these topics places you somewhere in between an alien and a child in their mind.  Trying to explain these concepts to a beginner can be like a fish explaining water to a bird.
* The theoretical underpinnings are deep and often crucial, and often glossed over in order to jump to the marketable skills.
* There's a huge culture built up around programming and software development, which carries with it a lot of baggage.  There are all sorts of rifts and holy wars within the field itself that contribute to an atmosphere that can feel unwelcoming to newcomers.  This isn't even to mention the stigmas and preconceptions held by people outside the field.

## Why learning to program rocks

On a more positive note, why is learning to program awesome?

* There are thousands of resources available, all of them assuming slightly different backgrounds.  Many, if not most, of these are available for free.  It's actually pretty amazing how much programmers seem to enjoy making books, blog posts, tutorials, and videos for others.  No matter your level of experience or knowledge, there is something out there for you.
* Programming bends your brain in all sorts of interesting ways that will bleed into your everyday life.  One develops a natural talent for abstraction, and after some time, you'll be able to express yourself both in programming and generally more effectively.
* The theoretical underpinnings are deep and often crucial.  The work is rooted in beauty that few fields share.
* You can engage in all sorts of fun, good-natured discourse.  Looking at computers today, it's amazing how much of their design \(both invisible and user-level\), has been shaped by the discourse and discussions in past decades.

## What this book is for

This book is _not_ for learning how to program, but instead for learning how to learn to program.  This is a crucial skill that's often overlooked.  Many programmers will tout the benefits of self-teaching, but without baseline knowledge, this is near-impossible.  I hope that perusing this book will give even the most naive beginner a foothold from which to choose a path forward.
