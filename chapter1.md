# What is programming, anyway?

## What you've been told

There are many commonly-held beliefs that are half-truths and myths.  I'll try to address some of the most common I've heard, and give a perspective that might be useful to an outsider.

### Programming is just giving a computer instructions

This is a case of a true but unhelpful fact.  When programming, one is give a computer instructions, but isn't this the same as moving a mouse and expecting the computer to move the cursor?  For this description of programming to be useful, some context needs to be introduced.

First, what sorts of things can we even ask a computer to do?  There are some requests that we can make that we input through an application, such as copying and pasting text, or refreshing the page in a browser.  These usually aren't considered programming.  Programming generally is used to describe giving more fundamental and menial instructions, that only become meaningful after some tricky construction.  It's like building a table from scratch versus from an IKEA kit.  The first requires skill, and can give a product more suited to one's needs, but a similar result might be easily constructed from a pre-made kit.

If the previous paragraph sounds cagey, that's because there are no hard distinctions in what constitutes programming or not.  There are programming languages TODO that consist of dragging and dropping blocks on a screen, and also programming languages that expose every wire in the machine to the programmer.  Hopefully, the rest of this chapter will clarify the differences.

### Programming is only for "X" people

There are several images that come to mind when thinking of programmers: the bearded man hunched in his parents' basement, the casually-dressed Silicon-Valley startup engineer, or perpetually overdressed square in the office.  They all exist, but aren't anywhere near comprehensive.

Who is a "programmer" is pretty ill-defined \(noticing a pattern?\), but you could make the argument that any businessperson putting together a complex spreadsheet, or chef writing a recipe are programmers.  At the very least, the same skillsets central to programming can enhance almost any career.

I personally have met people of all genders and orientations, all races, all ages, and all social preferences who participate in "programming."

### Programming is hard

### Programmers never get anything done

## What they're not telling you

There are also some tragically under-shared facts about programming that are worth mentioning.

### Programming is fun

### You never stop learning

### There are many ways to learn

## What are computers?

Okay, enough with the silly societal issues.  Let's get down to some cold hard programming.

### OS

### 1s and 0s

### Layered abstractions

### Really fast

## Why programming languages?

### Originally punch cards

### Computers weren't general purpose

### Languages are easier, and get more and more like English

### It's easier to reason about things that are similar to what we actually think

## Why is programming hard?

### If tools are getting better and better, why is it hard

### Simply, people had to make those tools

### Putting the tools together takes work

### There are a lot of tools

### Difficult problems

### Modularity
